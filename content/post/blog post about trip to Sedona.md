I recently visited Sedona for Christmas. We saw many nearby sites such as the Grand Canyon and Snoopy Rock. 

Sedona, located in Arizona, is a popular tourist destination known for its stunning red rock formations and natural beauty. In addition to the Grand Canyon, which is only a short drive away, visitors can also explore nearby attractions such as Snoopy Rock, which is named after the beloved Peanuts character, and the Red Rocks Amphitheater, which hosts music concerts and other events throughout the year. Other popular activities in Sedona include hiking, stargazing, and visiting local art galleries and shops. The town's unique atmosphere and friendly locals make it a must-visit destination for anyone looking to experience the beauty of Arizona.Ô∏è
